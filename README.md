**Problem We Are Solving**

In a world where everyone has a smartphone and many spend upwards of 7 hours a day using theirs, the current state of mobile games only contributes to the problem. With so many individual based games designed to guide you in passing time in solitude, people are less connected than ever. 
But what if we could turn back the clock to a simpler time where handheld devices were used to create a fun atmosphere with a group? 
What if we could bring back the twist? The spin? The pull? The Bop.
The problem we are trying to solve is that when people gather, many default to individual tasks or games on their phone. We want to provide a fun group activity that fits right into this scenario.

**What is our app?**

Our app provides a fun evolution of the hit game “Bop It” with mobile centric features and a boatload of fun. As we all know, the game Bop It was a smash hit, but in this day and age, things have changed, and so Bop It has to as well. This new mobile version of Bop It provides a collaborative multiplayer experience where players take turns trying to get the high score. Players are able to score points by completing tasks the app gives them in a certain period of time. While the original Bop It had tasks like Pulling, Pressing, and Twisting, we are taking a more mobile centric approach. Our app will have tasks such as Flip it (flip the phone over), Yell it (yell into the microphone), Tap it (perform a tapping task on the screen), Rotate it (rotate the phone to a specific XYZ position), and many others. Similar to games like Heads Up, we provide a fun group party type of experience, but with more outlandish and active tasks. 


**Who Are Our Natural Users?**

Our main users are really anyone looking for fun in a group of people. I would say in terms of age, there is a very wide spectrum, from say 15 to 50. That being said, different modes can be made for specific age groups. Given that this is a school project, we will assume the average user is a UW Madison student. 

**Our Competition**

Our main competition was an app by Bop It! themselves which was released in 2011 and not updated since. Another would be the app Tap Swipe Shake, that uses similar features to the original Bop It! mobile app that has the user completing an action based on the prompt which ranges from tapping the screen, swiping in a direction, or shaking the phone. The original bop it app was even less involved, only requiring swipes and taps. Both of these apps were fun but often become boring due to the repetitive nature of the tasks. Additionally these are solo player games that don't involve interaction with anyone else, our app aims to offer more dynamic and engaging tasks so the game is replayable and fun each time as well as involving a group of people who can work together or compete to win the top score.

**Our App’s Modules**

Generally, the main module of our app is the mobile device itself, as many of the tasks are mobile optimized and performed on device. That being said, a server may be implemented to create leaderboards for others who may want to play the game individually. Lastly, some external 3rd party services may be used for specific tasks. For example, in a more challenging mode of the game we may have a “Run It” task where we give the user a location on Google Maps and have them run to it in a certain amount of time. So in that sense, there may be some 3rd party one-off use cases. But generally, the main module will be the android device itself. 


**Mobile “Innovation”**

What makes our app truly mobile is that it will heavily use the gyroscope in order to confirm the player is carrying out the assigned tasks. It must do so for tasks such as ‘Flip It’, where the player must flip the phone over, or ‘Rotate It’, which has the player try to rotate the phone into a predetermined XYZ position in the world. This would be incredibly difficult with a desktop device because of the weight and general unwieldiness of it. We will additionally use features shared by both mobile and desktop devices such as the microphone, touchscreen capabilities, and potentially even the camera in order to keep the challenges from becoming too repetitive. The presence of a mobile device is essential in order to make our app function well and provide the user with a good experience that stays true to the original game.
